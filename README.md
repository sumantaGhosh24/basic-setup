## Points to remember
- The direction of lecture is specified on the html tag.
- HTML5 Semantic Elements are used appropriately (header, section, footer, main...).
- If IDs are used, they are unique to a page.
- All classes (or id- used in JavaScript files) begin with js- and are not styled into the CSS files.
- Avoid at all cost embeding CSS in `<style>` tags or using inline CSS.
- CSS files are concatenated in a single file (Not for HTTP/2).
- All pages were tested with the correct breakpoints.
- All CSS or SCSS files are without any errors.
- In case you are using external links with target="_blank", your link should have a rel="noopener" attribute to prevent tab nabbing. If you need to support older versions of Firefox, use rel="noopener noreferrer".
- All pages were tested on all current desktop browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, EDGE...).
- All pages were tested on all current mobile browsers (Native browser, Chrome, Safari...).
- All pages were tested on all current OS (Windows, Android, iOS, Mac...).
- You don't have any JavaScript code inline (mixed with your HTML code).
- JavaScript files are concatenated.
- You provide layout images 2x or 3x, support retina display.
- Small images are in a sprite file (in the case of icons, they can be in an SVG sprite image).
- Set width and height attributes on `<img>` if the final rendered image size is known (can be omitted for CSS sizing).
- All pages have an H1 which is not the title of the website.
- Headings should be used properly and in the right order (H1 to H6).
- This is especially important for mobile devices that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.
- Test your website using only your keyboard in a previsible order. All interactive elements are reachable and usable.
- If the focus is disabled, it is replaced by visible state in CSS.
- Your HTML, CSS & JavaScript is minified.
- No errors are flagged by ESLint (based on your configuration or standards rules).
- Optimize Image.
- Add lazy loading.
- Major functionality like main navigation and search should work without JavaScript enabled.
- This is especially important for mobile devices that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.
- All pages were tested in two or more screen readers (such as JAWS, VoiceOver, and NVDA).
- If you are using cookies be sure each cookie doesn't exceed 4096 bytes and your domain name doesn't have more than 20 cookies.
- An HTML sitemap is provided and is accessible via a link in the footer of your website.
